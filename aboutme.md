My research focuses on separating land degradation, climate variability and climate change in dryland regions using remote sensing. My particular focus to developing software tools that can be applied to large datasets to produce reliable and reproducible estimates of land degradation.   I'm currently completing my PhD at the UNSW Climate Change Research Centre under Prof. Jason Evans and Dr. Yi Liu.
