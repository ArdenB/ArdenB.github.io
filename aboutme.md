My research focuses on separating land degradation, climate variability and climate change in dryland regions using remote sensing. My particular focus is on improving the methods used to separate land degradation from climate induced vegetation variability. 

I'm currently completing my PhD at the UNSW Climate Change Research Centre under Prof. Jason Evans and Dr. Yi Liu. As part of this I developed the Time Series Segmented RESidual TRENDs (TSS-RESTREND) method [**(Burrell et al., 2017)**](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717302171). I published this method as an R-package which I continue to develop. The goal of this work is to create an open access software tool that can be applied to large datasets to produce reliable and reproducible estimates of land degradation.
