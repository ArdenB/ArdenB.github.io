I'm Arden Burrell, a remote sensing scientist doing my PhD at the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre. I'm also the developer of the TSS-RESTREND R-package which is available on both [**CRAN**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TSS.RESTREND/index.html) and [**Github**](https://github.com/ArdenB/TSSRESTREND).
